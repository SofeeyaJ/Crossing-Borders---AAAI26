# 🌏 Crossing Borders: A Multimodal Challenge for Indian Poetry Translation and Image Generation

**Accepted at AAAI-26**

---

## 🧾 Overview

**“Crossing Borders: A Multimodal Challenge for Indian Poetry Translation and Image Generation”** presents a novel framework — **Translation and Image Generation (TAI)** — that bridges the gap between **Indian-language poetry, translation, and AI-driven visualization**.

Indian poetry, known for its **linguistic richness** and **cultural depth**, often remains inaccessible to non-native speakers due to its layered metaphors, complex grammar, and cultural nuances. Our work aims to make Indian poetry **more globally accessible** by translating it accurately and generating **semantically grounded images** that preserve its cultural essence.

## 🧠 Abstract

> Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language.
>
> Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the **Translation and Image Generation (TAI)** framework, leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Latent Diffusion Models** through appropriate prompt tuning.
>
> Our framework supports the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals** of **Quality Education (SDG 4)** and **Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10)** by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes:
>
> 1. A **translation module** that uses an **Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm** to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English.
> 2. An **image generation module** that employs a **semantic graph** to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, generating visually meaningful representations of Indian poems.
>
> Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of **TAI Diffusion** in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines.
>
> To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the **MorphoVerse Dataset**, comprising **1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages**.
>
> By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader’s experience.
